# Arch Notes

For vim with clipboard:

```sh
sudo pacman -S gvim
```

Instead of `build-essential`:

```sh
sudo pacman -S base-devel
```

TODO:
- Use symlinks everywhere instead of copying
- Don't install if we've already got it (maybe figure out how to check for updates)?
- Have a certain list order for installing
